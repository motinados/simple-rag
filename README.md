# Simple RAG

This repository was created for me to learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
I have summarized it in [this article](https://moicko.com/posts/building-a-simple-rag-for-learning), so please feel free to take a look if you're interested.

## How to Set Up

### 1. Install dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set Your OpenAI API key:

To use the OpenAI API, you need to set your API key. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local` file.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Run the Development Server:

Once everything is set up, start the development server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
